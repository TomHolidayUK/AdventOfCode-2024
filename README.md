# AdventOfCode-2024

This December I will attemt the Advent of Code challenge. Last year I completed 18 days, hopefully this year I will be able to complete more. My primary language will be python but I may complete in other languages too for fun and for practice, probably in C++ and/or C.

Notes:
Day 1 - 9 were fairly self explanatory and you could just use basic logic to solve. After this point for most days I had to research what algorithm or method had to be applied before applying myself
Day 10 - DFS
Day 11 - DFS with memoisation (dynamic programming)
Day 12 - bit of DFS again (well connect the components algorithm to be more precise)
Day 13 - basic linear equations
Day 16 - Dijkstra's
Day 17 Pt 2 - Reverse engineering (i got stuck on this and had to see online solutions)
Day 18 - Dijkstra's
Day 19 - I got stuck here -  had to see online solution (dynamic programming)
